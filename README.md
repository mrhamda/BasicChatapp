# Abdullah Hamdan â€“ Basic chat app

The app is not made to be complex. It was made to show that I know how to use socket io and as well as vue. I did very basic chat app compared to the advanced one. You can enter what room you want to be in and send messages. I have in my github respositary a project called "chatAppAdvance" that is much more complex that this.
